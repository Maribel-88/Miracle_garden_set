## **Miracle Garden Set**
 A website project created to showcase what I have learnt so far from course modules.
 This dynamic website is composed of eight pages , the Home page, About, Contact, Deals, Refund, Terms, Order Status  and the Cart/basket page.
 In all the pages there are buttons that customers can click in order to go the the desired page. This website is built with customer in mind.
 I am looking for the web visitors to be able to view my products and be able to instantly placed there order. Phones numbers and email of the owner 
 is available for easy reached and to be able to process their order quicker or even to follow-up the orders.

 ### [Home Page](https://miraclegarden-set-90121c199093.herokuapp.com/)
 In the home page , I have implemented some bootstrap , HTML , CSS and small bit of Javascript in order to
 make the page more interactive and user friendly. Bootstrap icons made  the web page more engaging.
 I have showcase the products in the home page. I use CSS to design the box/grid where  I placed the items or product.
 I used some Javascript code in order to add items to the cart. The footer in the web page is simply done with HTML code.
 In this page , customer will view all the available products and prices. They will be able to add to cart their desired items 
 by clicking the plus icon  and minus icon to reduce the quantity or even delete the items from the cart.
