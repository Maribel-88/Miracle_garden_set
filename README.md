## **Miracle Garden Set**
 A website project created to showcase what I have learnt so far from course modules.
 This is our final project for this course. Im very thankful I was able to reached this far with this course.
 To my evaluator, this project is not only a representation of what I have learnt from this course but I should say this
 is the representation of my eagerness to learn this subject matter. I hope to continue on learning more in the future. 

 ### [Home Page](https://miraclegarden-set-90121c199093.herokuapp.com/)
 In the home page , I have implemented some bootstrap , HTML , CSS and small bit of Javascript in order to
 make the page more interactive and user friendly. Bootstrap icons made  the web page more engaging.
 I have showcase the products in the home page. I use CSS to design the box/grid where  I placed the items or product.
 I used some Javascript code in order to add items to the cart. The footer in the web page is simply done with HTML code.
 In this page , customer will view all the available products and prices. They will be able to add to cart their desired items 
 by clicking the plus icon  and minus icon to reduce the quantity or even delete the items from the cart.
